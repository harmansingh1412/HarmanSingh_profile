Hello! My name is Harman Singh and I am a graduate student in the Department of Geography at Penn State University, U.S.A. I am pursuing a Dual-title Ph.D. in **Geography** and **Climate Science** researching urban floods in India from a human-environment and hydrometeorology perspective.

I earned my B.Sc. in **Geography** with a minor in **Sustainability Leadership** from Penn State University in 2021.
