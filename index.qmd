Hello! My name is Harman Singh and I am a graduate student in the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.psu.edu/) at Penn State University, U.S.A. pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. in **Geography** and **Climate Science**. I earned my B.Sc. in **Geography** with a minor in **Sustainability Leadership** from Penn State University in 2021.

My research interests lie primarily in field of natural hazards and human-environmental systems. My Ph.D. research is grounded in disaster risk science, and I am interested in identifying future urban pluvial flood risks under a changing climate in India.
